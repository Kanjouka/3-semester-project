# 3SemesterScheduler-main

Third semester project for my AP degree in Computer Science from UCN.
Goal was to build an app for time management.
 - Allow employees to submit hourslips
 - Allow managers to approve or disapprove hourslips
 - Secure logins for both employee types. 

Currently not functional, as the database was lent to us from UCN.
Will update db scripts and manual to allow for testing.
